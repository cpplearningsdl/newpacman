You MUST create 2 folders in the directory the cpp files are in, defaultmaps, and usermaps, THEN add the files called 1.txt and 2.txt into default maps.

I meant to add a check during startup to create these things if they didn't exist, but I never got around to it.

I don't think there are too many BIG bugs, if there are its most likely in the level loading functions, especially relating to maps not existing and using random default ones,
i didnt really test that enough. I also meant to go back and check the SCATTER mode because it felt like that wasn't triggering but I never did test it.
